# Chevereto-Free

> The "Chevereto-Free" project is **archived** and superseed by "Chevereto" at [chevereto/chevereto](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto).

"Chevereto-Free" is not longer updated neither maintained, it holds code old as 2020 and it runs on a deprecated PHP version. Is not safe to use "Chevereto-Free".

Read about it at [Chevereto goes free](https://rodolfoberrios.com/2022/12/01/chevereto-goes-free/)

Please note that most projects around "Chevereto-Free" wrongly use the word "Chevereto" to refer to the project/code. I used the name "Chevereto-Free" because the software project is different, please don't spoil it by chopping "-Free" when refering to this code.
